# Overview
With an opportunity to intern at Sierra Space next summer, our goal is to both meet the intent of the assignment, and build a project that can be displayed in a portfolio to showcase skills Sierra Space are looking for. We want to show conceptual design, the ability to conduct concept reviews, and manufacturing. Additionally, we want to use VR for storytelling, both in marketing and the business world, and also with concept design of new space habitat, and vehicles. We are envisioning  three floors or modules including lab space, kitchen, garden, and sleeping quarters. This is similar to an actual life habitat for Sierra, which is a 27-foot diameter capsule.

# Explanation
	To complete homework two, we will design a VR environment which will incorporate selection and manipulation controls. This will be done by simulating a space shuttle with various control panels and assets throughout a room. The player will then use VR-controls to select and manipulate various components and assets to a proper destination, completing these tasks in given sequences or through given steps.

# Assets
	To complete this lab, we will use various digital and physical assets to simulate the given environment and achieve the listed objectives.
	For provided assets, we will use the issued Oculus Quest VR headset along with provided UE5 software programs. The operation of the environment will happen on a swivel chair in a room with enough space to freely spin and move a few feet in each direction. For assets we need to produce, we will have to render visual simulations of the designed components, the virtual environment, as well as controls and software to make listed operations actually run.
For the coding and software, we will have to program two main tasks: giving the controller specified instructions and managing object manipulation.
Doubled HW2
	Because our group is only completing homework two, we are required to double the amount of content and deliverables within this assignment. To accomplish this, we will add two primary functionalities: a navigation concept and additional levels.
	The proposal has already discussed the selection and manipulation aspects of our interactive activity, and for the larger scale of our homework two we will also be implementing navigation mechanics. The primary idea for navigation we have involves both moving assets throughout the environment and the player themselves navigating throughout a simulated environment. 
	To double the amount of content in this homework assignment, we will at least double the amount of assets, content, and virtual environment by adding various “levels” through which the player will move. Via whatever navigation system best minimizes sickness and works within the scope of our program, the player will move throughout these levels, which will simulate floors or modules, to deliver components to specific locations and perform tasks as required. One idea we have already discussed is to have the player sit on a swivel chair, on which they will be able to spin to face various sides of the room. In addition to the chair’s ability to spin, it will be able to move around in a planar and somewhat unfamiliar fashion (as opposed to walking). For moving between levels or in other areas, we would use a teleportation control, since this would minimize sickness.
	Lastly, for additional content, we will add features and refine the original design. We will do this by adding a few more objects or panels, and enhancing the selection and manipulation mechanics, simulating them in a zero-gravity environment. 
	
# Conclusion
Please contact us with any questions, we have arranged a meeting with professor Ortega to discuss the scale and scope of this homework assignment. Other than what was discussed above, we have nothing additional to state at this time.
