# Project outline and description:

Locations
  -Floor 1:
    -Airlock: Area for incoming shipments/supplies, objects will spawn here for transfer
    -Storage/Galley: Area for storing objects or retrieving stored objects
    -Greenhouse: Area with growing plants, deliver/retrive specific objects here
    -robot work stations: Complete basic tasks here
  -Floor 2:
    -Water Life Support: Maintain water levels and tasks here.
    -Air Life Support: Maintain oxygen levels or pressure here.
    -Temperature: Maintain temperature or humidity level here.
    -Medical: Deliver or retrieve supplies from here
  -Floor 3:
    -Command console: Get instructions/carry out tasks here. There will be an interface with every possible task to complete, the user can select one given task then be walked through the steps
    via commands on screen or listed instructions.
    -Science lab: Complete tasks here
    -Hygene: Deliver supplies to this location
    -Excercise: Git Swol here
    
Example Task:
    Replenish Water:
      1. Discharge black water/ direct brown water to plants (water life support)
      2. Guide new shipment to airlock (Robot work station)
      3. Open Airlock (Command Console)
      4. Move water to position (Airlock-Storage)
      5. Replenish water (Storage-Water life support)
      6. Verify Water is secure (water life support)
      7. Confirm Task Completiong (Command Console)
      
 Other tasks could include adjusting life supports, analyzing plant samples, maintaining the greenhouse, or manipulating other needed supplies.
 
 ASSETS TO DESIGN:
 Command Console: Computer looking object with the ability to select/read from the screen
 Science Lab: Table with computers/fancy looking equipment. Have 3 different possible "Samples"--small moveable objects
 Hygene: Maybe just have a closed off room
 Excercise: Have a peleton or something
 Medical: just like a bench or something
 All three life supports: can be variations of the same control panel. Should be able to have an interfact the user can manipulate in two different ways (increase/decrease various factors)
 Robot work stations: Another console, with interacting levers/buttons
 Greenhouse: Row of plants on a table, with plant assets that may be removed.
 Storage: just a few walls/shelves, should be able to select from as you store/move stuff
 airlock: Circle in wall where assets will spawn.
